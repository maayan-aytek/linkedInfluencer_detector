As the Industrial Era fades, its legacy systems still permeate work and education. The Intelligence Era is not yet here, but it presents a design challenge because it contains many intangible and even invisible components, like code, algorithms, evolving cultures and identities, and huge amounts of data that must be turned into insights if we are to succeed in designing new systems. Since imagination is how the neurons in our brain make connections between ideas, it seemed like the perfect way to break out the period in between these two longer eras. It takes imagination to get away from legacy systems, whether technological or cultural, and it takes imagination to shape the new era which isn't yet here. Dancing Ink Productions clients include IBM, Manpower, the British Council, the National Institute of Aerospace and more. I continue to develop the Imagination Age at Science House.

I guess in many ways I wanted a more diverse and #inclusive knowledge before those terms were mainstream. Even in the early days of social media I was somewhat of a disrupted to exact intent of the platform. Many ‘well-meaning’ 🫢 people went out of their way to remind me this is not Facebook! I took it in stride and used my creative style to post the things that I felt were common to all people. As a result I met the most fascinating people who seemed to have their own perceptions about our society. Today we are a registered #nonprofit with the goal of providing resources in #education and helping disadvantaged people in the communities around the world who need help they don’t get from large nonprofits. Currently we have 19,000 #volunteers in 215 nations and territories. I love what I do because now semi-retired from 35 years of in the corporate world, I get to speak to and help people.

In my career, many great artists have inspired me. But a great mentor like Richard does not walk into your life every day. I have been in close association with Richard on LinkedIn for several years. His expertise and benevolence would be challenging at best to escape attention. I have always considered it a blessing by God to be a perfectionist in my chosen field. And the people I work with depend on that attribute to be the best I can be for any given project. I proudly admit that I have scrupulously observed Richard Di Pilla, and I've never been disappointed. Richard and his theologian relationship with humanity are only one of the reasons I refer to him as my mentor! His works are always profoundly consistent with his global and amiable directives. I earnestly can't imagine any adversity in life that Richard could experience that he would not overcome with the utmost dignity. How does one measure the lifelong and heartfelt characteristic blessings of a person? If I was not presently speaking of Richard Di Pilla, that is the embodiment above. I suppose I would have to call him on the phone and ask him that question. I can guarantee anyone without any doubt Richard would know.

He has real feelings for human beings especially those who are poor, people from social exclusion zones, and destitute. In addition, I am also profoundly impressed with Richard's quality of Leadership, vision, strategic thinking transforming it into strategic planning, good governance, etc. to shape the GGA as the most credible and world-class viable Humanitarian organization within the period of eight years since its birth. Currently, GGA's humanitarian services have been extended to 215 countries and territories. On Management policy issues, GGA's autonomous status helps attuned local initiatives that result in effective service delivery where is needed most. It is an example of a customized (tailor-made) individual countries/territories needs. Richard is blessed with a listening skill. He is prepared to listen to his GGA colleagues and takes decisions that is best for GGA. An example, I was a Guest Speaker at The UN World Oceans Day 2020 Side Event hosted by HIRED Consult on June 08. John Aggrey, Founder & CEO, Hired Consult was desperately looking for an opening Special Guest Speaker at the above event.
